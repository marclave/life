# Viterbi Algorithm

## What
The Viterbi algorithm is a Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithm for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states, with a Hidden Markov Model.

## Why
This algorithm has many applications: space communications, speech recognition; however for this implementation 
it is for Error Control Coding.


## Introduction Example
The example file contains a simple generic implementation of the Viterbi Algorithm.
